# Jufl iOS Application

## About

Jufl is a social networking concept that encourages friends to meet face-to-face more. 

It allows friends to broadcast last minute events such as coffee catchups.

## Team

I had the original idea with a friend. We raised some money to pay to have it built.

I project-managed teams from Australia, New Zealand and India.

## Learning

Working with contractors is **tough**. It's really important to be fully across the tech stack, make sure you only build the most important parts, and that you give very, very specific instructions. You can't expect contracted developers to go above and beyond or do the thinking for you.
